Practical session MAV 104 (University of Gothenburg). The purpose of these exercises is to get acquainted with data collected with CTD. During the exercises you will use Jupyter Notebook and the Python programming language to load and visualize data. The dataset you are going to work with consists of CTD data collected along a transect just west of Gibraltar.

The practical is divided in 3 exercises:
1. CTD profiles: Visualize these data in three separate line graphs, one each for temperature, salinity and oxygen respectively.
2. Visualize CTD transect: Use all available CTD data from the transect and visualize this as a two-dimensional surface with depth along the y-axis, latitude along the x-axis and colors that show the values of the various parameters. 
3. TS diagram: A common and useful way to show the presence and distribution of different water masses is a T-S diagram. This type of diagram shows data as point clouds in a coordinate system with salinity on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis. Often the dots are colored based on the depth where the measurement was made.


Inspired in Vilhelm Fagerström MAV104 2020 practical session.
